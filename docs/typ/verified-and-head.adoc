= `typ/verified-and-head.t`

 This rule extends the typechecker so that then the `Tail` expression of `(and Head Tail)` expressions
 is typechecked, any `verified` rules that result from `Head` are are taken into account.

 Example:

 ```shen
 (define test
   { A --> boolean }
   X -> (and (number? X) (> X 0)))
 ```

 The above code doesn't typecheck by default, but if `typ/verified-and-head.t` and `typ/verified-objects.t`
 are enabled it does.
